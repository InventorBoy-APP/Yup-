              Our high school allows kids to be free, and not be shifiting to classes very 40 minutes. We have a system where every 2 hourse of the school day, our students would be allowed to go outside for a little bit of fresh air for 20 minutes, jut so they have enough enrgy to continue on with the school day. The sports we do are basketball and soccer. Our basketball and soccer team name is the "Revving Kars. Pretty nice name, am I right? The school day will consist of 4 core subjects and 6 additional subjects, going on a scehdule that will allow them to have a different additional activity every day.

              We have won many awards, including the district championship. Also, Suprise Suprise! One of our 11th grade students has won the Nobel Peace Prize for finding out a new element for the periodic table of elements! We have also gotten many "Best School Of The Year " awards in the past. The first award we had gotten was back in 2011, where we earned the basketball championship award.

              Here came Covid-19, and we had to shut down school for about 6 months and go online. A lot has changed since March of 2020. Now we are back in school, and as fresh as ever! We require students to wear their mask's inside the building but they are allowed to take off their mask's outside. We have gotten many new teachers in the building which allow kids to have smaller classes, which encourages more participation between them all.
